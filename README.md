Just a beginner project that I copied from the main game from "Clear Code" and add some modification.
It is not an enterprise or any profit. For my personal to learn basic knowlegde of pygame.

What I added
 1. Main Menu
 2. Option that can increase or decrease the sound
 3. Pause state that u can pause the game during game

I tried my pixel buttons for the first time.
